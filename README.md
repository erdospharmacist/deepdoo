Welcome to the "Deepdoodoo" project! 🐾💩

## 🎯 What is This Repository About? ##

This repository contains code, tools, and resources aimed at detecting and identifying dog poo in grass environments. While it might seem like a trivial task, our goal is to create a solution that can help maintain cleanliness and hygiene in public spaces (specifically my backyard) by automating the detection of this common issue.

## 🛑 How to Use ##

Here's a quick guide on how to use our tool:

And voilà! Our tool will help identify those pesky dog poos with ease.
